    The Logger and Config classes have been moved back into the
    Pinto distribution.  Now that they have a more specialized
    purpose, is no longer necessary to put them in a separate
    distribution.  So this dist now only contains Pinto::Types
    and Pinto::Manual.

    Logger output is now colorized.  You can disable colorization in
    your configuration.

    You can now tell Pinto::Logger where to write to.  This can be a
    file, a filehandle, or a scalar ref.  This is mostly useful for
    testing purposes.
