    Added DistributionSpec and PackageSpec classes.

    Enhanced the Import action to accept either a
    DistributionSpec or PackageSpec as the target.

0.036     2012-04-08 23:38:19 America/Los_Angeles

    Reorganized roles into different directory/package structure.

0.035     2012-04-04 18:55:44 America/Los_Angeles

    Revised the Pinto::Manual.  This is still a work in progress.

    This distribution now contains several Roles and other
    bits that are shared by both Pinto and Pinto::Remote.

0.020     2011-12-02 03:01:01 America/Los_Angeles

    Renamed the URI type to Uri, to avoid conflict
    with the URI class name.

0.019     2011-11-23 15:36:33 America/Los_Angeles

    Added the Vers type (for version objects).

0.018     2011-08-30 01:13:35 America/Los_Angeles

    Added Pinto::Constants, for constant values that are shared
    by the various pinto-* utilities.

0.017     2011-08-24 00:20:47 America/Los_Angeles

    The Logger and Config classes have been moved back into the
    Pinto distribution.  Now that they have a more specialized
    purpose, is no longer necessary to put them in a separate
    distribution.  So this dist now only contains Pinto::Types
    and Pinto::Manual.

0.015     2011-08-18 10:30:01 America/Los_Angeles

    Logger output is now colorized.  You can disable colorization in
    your configuration.

0.014     2011-08-17 22:56:04 America/Los_Angeles

    You can now tell Pinto::Logger where to write to.  This can be a
    file, a filehandle, or a scalar ref.  This is mostly useful for
    testing purposes.

0.013     2011-08-17 15:55:53 America/Los_Angeles

    Initial release.
